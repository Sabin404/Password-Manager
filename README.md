# Password Manager 
This project is a simple Password Manager web application designed to help users securely store and manage their website login credentials. The web page includes input fields for the website URL, username, and password, along with buttons to save and delete data. Users can input their login information and save it using the "Save data" button. The saved data is stored locally in the browser's storage. Additionally, users can delete all saved data using the "Delete Data" button. The Password Manager dynamically displays saved passwords in a table format below the input fields. Each password entry in the table includes a "Copy" button, allowing users to easily copy the associated password to the clipboard for convenience. Overall, this project provides a convenient solution for users to manage their website login credentials securely within their browser.
